# my dotfiles
these are my dotfiles. this contains configuration for tools such as [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as well as for my desktop environment.

## installation
requires [gnu stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). simply clone the repository and run `stow *` from within the clone to install all parts, or `stow <folder>` to install only some components (this is useful when installing on a server or other remote environment where graphical components are unneccessary).
